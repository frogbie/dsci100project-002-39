    "Understanding player engagement is a critical aspect of game research, influencing game design, resource allocation, and targeted player recruitment, which has led to increased interest in analyzing player activity data. A research group in the Computer Science department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), led by Frank Wood, is investigating how players interact with video games by collecting their in-game behavioral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their study, the research team has set up a Minecraft server, where players' in-game actions are recorded as they navigate through the virtual world. The data collected provides an understanding of how different types of players engage with the game. However, not all players contribute equally. Some engage with the game significantly more than others, and running such a project efficiently requires targeted recruitment strategies to attract the players who will contribute more data. By identifying player characteristics that correlate with high levels of engagement, the research team can focus their recruitment efforts on individuals who are most likely to generate the data that they are looking for."
