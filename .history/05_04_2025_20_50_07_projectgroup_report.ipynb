    "Understanding player engagement is a critical aspect of game research, influencing game design, resource allocation, and targeted player recruitment, which has led to increased interest in analyzing player activity data. A research group in the Computer Science department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), led by Frank Wood, is investigating how players interact with video games by collecting their in-game behavioural data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their study, the research team has set up a Minecraft server, where players' in-game actions are recorded as they navigate through the virtual world. The data collected provides an understanding of how different types of players engage with the game. However, not all players contribute equally. Some engage with the game significantly more than others, and running such a project efficiently requires targeted recruitment strategies to attract the players who will contribute more data. By identifying player characteristics that correlate with high levels of engagement, the research team can focus their recruitment efforts on individuals who are most likely to produce relevant and necessary data."

    "To answer the research question, we will use linear regression as our primary method, using it to predict the total number of hours a player contributes to the data based on experience, gender, and age. Linear regression is the ideal method since it allows for predictions between multiple predictors and a continuous dependent variable (total hours played). This method provides straightfoward model that can be easily manipulated and adjusted, but only under the assumption that the relationship between our predictors and dependent variable is linear. However, since experience and gender are categorical variables, they need to be converted to unique numerical values before analysis. "

    "Through our data analysis we’ve discovered that the players of *Amateur* level contribute the highest number of hours played compared to that of *Beginner*, *Experienced*, *Pro*, and *Veteran* playing times. This suggests that amateur players potentially have both a combination of growing interest and time availability.\n",

Important to note that there is an outlier in the data that *Non-binary* peoples contributed, which probably should not be considered. The data for *Non-binary* players includes an outlier that disprportinately skews the average playtime. This anomaly should be exluded when interpreting overal trends as it doesn't accurately reflect patterns within this demographic."

Additionally, the findings from the age demographic of 15-30 aligned with our assumptions that they'd produce the highest played hours, as well as the fact that *Males* led gender playing time in our data set."

    "Again, understanding player engagement is an essential aspect of game research, influencing promotional efforts, resource allocation, and targeted player recruitment. By identifying which *age*, *gender*, and *experience level* groups contribute the most amount to played hours, game developers, researchers, and more can use these findings to help refine and cater to the right demographics, while also allocating time and budget to recruit less involved players. This dual approach not only enhances the reach, and inclusivity of future design efforts, but also supports the development of more balanced and player-centered game design."
